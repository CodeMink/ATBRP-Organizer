# ATBRP-Organizer
Advanced Text-Based Roleplaying Character File Organizer, for the ultimate PBP nerds and your sad, sad existence on this planet.

If you find yourself scouring the cesspits of the internet for a convenient way to organize your 50 million warrior gnomes and busty elf barbarians into a coherent structure, then stop, take those filthy sticky hands off your keyboard, and seriously reconsider your life choices. Just think about it. What sad pathetic chain of events led you to this? Is it worth it? Are you HAPPY? Is this what you want from life?

Still there? Then welcome to the ATBRP Organizer! This is a project created in the absence of any better ones. Think of it as a customizable, personal wiki for your RP charries. Made with bad spaghetti code and a dying programming language.

I'm not even trying, honestly.
